# ACOS
An online operating system, made for fun ;) !

You can use it as you wish.
**[Use it with this link ;\) !](http://matrobot.free.fr/acos-remastered/)**

# Features
ACOS works with cookies and apps.

## Apps
### BuildIt!
This system app allow you to customize your ACOS ! Change the theme or the language *(translations soon)* !

### TextRock
A simple plain text editor, that allows you to edit text, save it, and download it.

You can now also open from a text file.

### Filesystem
This files system allows you to store your files.

Actually, you can only :
- Create textrock files and open them
- Create folders **BUT YOU CAN'T OPEN THEM OR STORE ANYTHING INSIDE**
- The context menu is not working, files/folders deletions coming soon.

### Apps browser
Allows you to browse for a few apps, and install them.

# APIs
Soon !

# How to install
First, download the `acos-remastered.zip` from the latest version.

Then depends of your platform :

## Windows
Download [WAMPServer](https://www.wampserver.com/).

Run the downloaded executable, and install it.

Then, go in the folder where you installed WAMPServer, normally named `wamp64`.

Go in the folder `www`, and paste the ZIP.

Extract the ZIP in a folder named `acos-remastered`.

***Pay attention :** If you open the folder `acos-remastered`, and it contains another folder `acos-remastered`, move the content of this second folder into the first. Then delete this second folder. Otherwise, this will not work.*

## Mac
Apply the Windows procedure, but with [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).

## Linux
Same as Windows, but with [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/fr/index.html).

**Then, go in your favourite browser and type `localhost/acos-remastered/` in the URL bar.**
